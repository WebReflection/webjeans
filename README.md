### About

Every time I click some BlueJeans link from a calendar or elsewhere, their page keeps asking me to download their app, offering down the page a link to go to the Website, WebRTC based, version.

As a Web developer, and a Web lover, I'm tired of services that keep forcing users to use their app, specially when users are on Linux, as it is in my case, where their app doesn't even work too well.

This extension does one thing and one thing only: it redirects you to the WebRTC version of the meeting if you land on a bluejeans related URL, and that's all folks ðŸ‘‹
